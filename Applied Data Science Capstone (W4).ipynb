It has been dubbed as 'Start up capital' and one of the worlds best cities to live in. \n\nTo support start ups, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) government has introduced various grant opportunities, such as InnovationConnect, which provides grants of up to $50,000 to help Canberra-based businesses develop their products and services. Similarly, for up-and-coming entrepreneurs, there\u2019s InnovationACT, a business plan competition for university students, run by the Australian National University and the University of Canberra.\n\nHaving lived in Canberra and as a former student of Australian National University, I am interested in exploring the possibility of opening a take-away restaurant for offices and students/graduates of nearby universities.\n\nPS. This idea is inspired from one of the blog posts at towardsdatascience.com"
